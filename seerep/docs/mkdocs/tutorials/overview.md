# Tutorials Overviews

The tutorials provide a starting point on how you can use SEEREP. Currently, the following topics are covered:

- Creating and Retrieving projects
- Sending and Querying images

Before running any of the tutorials, make sure that
you have a  **running SEEREP instance available**.

## Local Instance

To start SEEREP locally use `STRG+SHIFT+D` to open the Run & Debug Menu in Vs-Code, select `seerep server` and press run.
Now a terminal should open and print the following info messages:

```bash
